#Sensor Simulators

To simplify the development of sensor consumers, like the web service, virtual sensors can be started to simulate power consumption.

Installation
----------------
1. Install the homesensors modules (see HomeEnergyConsumptionTracker/homesensors .
2. pip install -r setup/requirements.txt

Running the electricity sensor
-----------------
realTimeElectricityTickSensorSimulator.py will start an electricity sensor with ID=1. 
- The sensor will output 750W to 1250W.
